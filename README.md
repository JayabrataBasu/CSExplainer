# Visual Scene Understanding AI

A neuro-symbolic AI system that combines machine learning for object detection with symbolic reasoning to interpret scenes and generate natural language descriptions.

## Features

- Object detection using pre-trained neural networks
- Symbolic reasoning about object relationships
- Natural language generation of scene descriptions

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python src/main.py`

## Project Structure

- `src/ml/`: Machine learning components for object detection
- `src/symbolic/`: Symbolic reasoning engine and rules
- `src/nlg/`: Natural language generation
- `src/interface/`: User interface components
